        "accumulator": "The total accumulated quantity (e.g. total energy accumulated).",
        "alarm": "A point that interprets some input values qualitatively (e.g. as good or bad, normal or in alarm, etc.). Alarms are always binary.",

        "status": "The multistate value indicating an observed state in a piece of equipment, often indicating if a command was effected. It is a neutral observation (e.g. no quality judgment of \"good\" or \"bad\"). It also has no units of measurement (therefore if combined with a measurement subfield, it will indicate that the field is the directional status based on some measurement of that type, e.g. power_status equates to an on/off value based on some inference of power).",
